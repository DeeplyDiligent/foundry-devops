HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS   In-Network Providers   HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS   When selecting a health insurance plan, one of the most important factors to consider is the   network of in-network providers that are available with the plan.

This allows you to choose a provider   that is convenient for you and your family, while also helping you to keep your costs low.

In addition, many   services, such as preventive care, may be covered at no cost when you receive care from an   in-network provider.    It is important to note, however, that Northwind Standard does not offer coverage for   emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-network     services.

If the provider is too far away, it may be   difficult for you to get to your appointments.    Finally, consider the provider's office hours. If you work during the day, you may need to   find a provider that has evening or weekend hours.\n\nNorthwind_Standard_Benefits_Details.pdf: weekend hours.
